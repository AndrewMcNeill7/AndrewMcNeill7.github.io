                    This page gives a broad overview of Andrew Alphonza McNeill's professional life, highlighting both my past experiences and my future goals.
                    I attended KingsFord Elementary School from second through sixth grade, where my career path began. By adapting the concept from male leaders in my life such as my father Timothy McNeill, 
                    KingsFord Elementary School gave me the framework for success.
                    After elementary school, I took honors level STEM subjects, which aided in my pursuit of excellence. I attended Ernest E. Just Middle School at that time. The STEM programs exposed me to a variety of STEM topics 
                    and helped me recognize the topics in STEM that I found most intriguing. I was interested in college during elementary and middle school and always knew I was going to college, but I had no idea where I was going or what I was going to study.
                    I completed the Science & Technology Scholars program at Charles Herbert Flowers High School and graduated.
                    Due to the fact that technology was the only component of the curriculum that intrigued me and was something I could see myself doing as a career, I attribute my current success to enrolling in that program. I made the decision to continue my academic career by enrolling 
                    at Towson University to study information technology in November of 2018.

                    Towson University introduced me to the various technological fields, such as software development, web development, database administration, and data science, that I could enter.
                    Web technologies, advanced data management and analysis, fundamentals of systems administration, applied data mining and visual analysis, and other courses are only a few of the subjects that these four 
                    professional sectors provide to the information technology degree curriculum.
                    The Towson University curriculum was excellent since it allowed me to take classes in which my interests would shift depending on the semester. After my first semester at Towson University was through, 
                    I decided that I wanted to work as a database administrator, the next semester a security analyst, data scientist, and lastly web developer.Due to my success in a basic HTML and CSS course, web development is the area of technology in which I am most interested.
                    My final project in the course was a five-page website,
                    and I decided that web development would be my future. I made the decision to study JavaScript after reading Jon Duckett's book JavaScript with jQuery, which enabled me to give websites more features.
                    Making this website has allowed me to make use of the Towson University curriculum and produce a project that I might add to my résumé while looking for full-time jobs in web development.

                        Since it involves three exciting components, web development is the career path I'll pursue. Front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development are the three components. 
                        The fact that there are three components allows me to keep working on new projects and offers my work an agile mindset. The creation of graphical user interfaces for websites using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript is the responsibility of front-end development.
                        The methods used by PHP, Python, and JavaScript to process data and carry out actions on websites are built and maintained by back-end development. Website front-end interfaces and back-end procedures are made by full-stack developers.I was able to practice my front-end abilities while building this website because I used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to make an interactive interface. 
                        I additionally learned how to upload a website from a local computer to the internet and the features of websites. I'll soon acquire up the relevant back-end development skills as my web development career progresses in order to achieve my ultimate goal of becoming a full stack developer.
