        I have interests and hobbies in my daily life that enable me to discover ways to occupy my time besides using technology. 
        The English Premier League, catching Polaroid pictures, spending time with family, and seeing the newest movies are my main interests. 
        Each of these hobbies has originated from a different area of my life, which has helped me develop into the hobbiesI like. Because I played youth soccer, 
        the English Premier League has been a part of my life since I was ten. Whenever I returned from a game, I would watch English professionals play and pick up 
        tips from them. Since 2022, Polaroid photography has become a significant part of my life. Since I bought a Polaroid photo printer, I've started printing pictures.
        Seeing family as a child was wonderful. My parents would usually take my siblings and I to our grandparents' homes for family holidays. when I got older, spending 
        time with family became natural to me, and it's something I hope to instill in my children when they become older. Finally, I enjoy seeing horror and thriller films, 
        so going to the movies has always been a positive experience for me.
