                    My name is Andrew A. McNeill, and I am a 22-year-old recent graduate hoping to 
                    advance in the web development industry. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Information 
                    Technology during my academic career at Towson University. Additionally, I'm a graduate 
                    student at Towson University studying computer science in order to further my education and 
                    increase my knowledge in web development. I've held a variety of technology-related jobs 
                    throughout my career, including information desk assistant for information and computational 
                    sciences, front end web developer, information technology support student, computer support 
                    assistant, and currently information technology specialist.

                    Towson University introduced me to the various technological fields, such as software development, web development, database administration, and data science, that I could enter.
                    Web technologies, advanced data management and analysis, fundamentals of systems administration, applied data mining and visual analysis, and other courses are only a few of the subjects that these four 
                    professional sectors provide to the information technology degree curriculum.
                    The Towson University curriculum was excellent since it allowed me to take classes in which my interests would shift depending on the semester. After my first semester at Towson University was through, 
                    I decided that I wanted to work as a database administrator, the next semester a security analyst, data scientist, and lastly web developer.Due to my success in a basic HTML and CSS course, web development is the area of technology in which I am most interested.
                    My final project in the course was a five-page website,
                    and I decided that web development would be my future. I made the decision to study JavaScript after reading Jon Duckett's book JavaScript with jQuery, which enabled me to give websites more features.
                    Making this website has allowed me to make use of the Towson University curriculum and produce a project that I might add to my résumé while looking for full-time jobs in web development.

                        Since it involves three exciting components, web development is the career path I'll pursue. Front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development are the three components. 
                        The fact that there are three components allows me to keep working on new projects and offers my work an agile mindset. The creation of graphical user interfaces for websites using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript is the responsibility of front-end development.
                        The methods used by PHP, Python, and JavaScript to process data and carry out actions on websites are built and maintained by back-end development. Website front-end interfaces and back-end procedures are made by full-stack developers.I was able to practice my front-end abilities while building this website because I used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to make an interactive interface. 
                        I additionally learned how to upload a website from a local computer to the internet and the features of websites. I'll soon acquire up the relevant back-end development skills as my web development career progresses in order to achieve my ultimate goal of becoming a full stack developer.
