                    My name is Andrew A. McNeill, and I am a 22-year-old recent graduate hoping to advance in the web development industry. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Information 
                    Technology during my academic career at Towson University. Additionally, I'm a graduate student at Towson University studying computer science in order to further my education and 
                    increase my knowledge in web development. I've held a variety of technology-related jobs throughout my career, including information desk assistant for information and computational 
                    sciences, front end web developer, information technology support student, computer support 
                    assistant, and currently information technology specialist.

                <p>
                    As a Front End Web Developer, I successfully created and maintained over 50 pages by employing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am well-versed in utilizing modern frameworks like React and Angular to build dynamic 
                    and responsive user interfaces. My experience extends beyond mere coding, as I actively contributed to the enhancement of user experiences by transforming ideas into design mockups and prototypes. I take pride in my meticulous 
                    approach to problem-solving, using raw debugging tools like Firebug and Chrome Inspector to identify and resolve issues before publication. This proactive approach not only ensures the delivery of high-quality code but also contributes 
                    to a seamless and bug-free user experience. My dedication to bridging the gap between design and development is evident in my ability to translate ideas into tangible, visually appealing designs that strengthen overall user interactions. 
                    I believe in the importance of collaboration and effective communication to achieve project goals and deliver outstanding results. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my technical skills, creativity, and dedication to your team. 
                    I am confident that my background in Front End Development, coupled with my passion for creating seamless and visually appealing web experiences, makes me a strong candidate for this position.

                    As a Information Technology Support Student, I used company troubleshooting resolution documentation to assess technical issues and identify suitable fixes. Installation, relocation, and replacement of computers; assistance with the housing 
                    database program Mercury; help for the IT and marketing coordinator; maintenance and repair of community center desk hardware; and building identification cards. As a computer support assistant, I was responsible for maintaining the WordPress 
                    online interfaces used by Johns Hopkins University, including interface backups, plugin updates, and user access. I also used Microsoft Forms to create a number of forms needed by the Johns Hopkins Technology Innovation Center, facilitating efficient 
                    departmental communication. Finally, I offered desk side support services to non-technical internal users as Tier 1 IT support. In my current position as an Information Technology Specialist, I provide technical support for the installation, configuration, 
                    setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting of computer systems, hardware, and software. I also troubleshoot and resolve Tier I and II incidents, such as system inquiries, requests, incidents, software installation, printer support, hardware support, and maintain 
                    the chronic care IQ healthcare database to store patient records, create medical notes, and keep you informed. These jobs have given me the opportunity to hone my technical abilities in network configuration and troubleshooting, information security procedures, 
                    and computer hardware and software maintenance.

                    My bachelor's degree gave me a foundational understanding of programming, but my master's degree will provide me the skills I need to become an expert programmer. Through the chance to work with a Towson University research program, I hope to further hone my abilities 
                    to use technology to make working industries more productive. Modern technology is amazing because it makes it possible for people to complete straightforward activities much faster. Being in the working industry's technology sector, I believe I owe it to other sectors 
                    that are less technically inclined to give them the technological techniques that can make their operations operate much more efficiently, creating a partnership that is mutually beneficial. Creating opportunities for individuals in the different working industries and 
                    individuals in the technology industry. Allowing me the chance to create opportunities for others that I wish I had growing up.
